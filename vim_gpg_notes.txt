1. Create an empty file with the following command:

gpg --encrypt --sign --armour -r sybrandy@gmail.com -o test.gpg test.txt

This is good for when we want to encrypt personal files.  To interact with a
different user, we need to change the value for "-r" to the target user.

2. Cannot verify signed files with the --verify option.  That option is only
for separate signature files.  Decrypting a file will verify it's signature.

3. To preserve signing the files, need to explicitly set the sign flag by
doing the following:

  1. :GPGEditOptions
  2. Add a line for the value "sign"
  3. Close the buffer.
  4. Verify by calling :GPGViewOptions
